# CodeNation-Python-Game
This was the code for the gaming project which I created as a team. 
I organised the Trello (where we planned the game), I created the narrative driven storyline, I helped others with coding issues, I managed the team and I also created the powerpoint slides for the final presentation, effectively making sure we reached the deadline early.

This game was created for a CodeNation bootstrap 4 week course project and we only used the python language.
